# Obsolete

This is a fork of the [Subtext blog engine](https://github.com/haacked/Subtext)
-- originally created by [Phil Haack](https://github.com/haacked).

It was used for several years as the blog platform for the Technology Toolbox
website [https://www.technologytoolbox.com](https://www.technologytoolbox.com).
However, that website has since been migrated to a static website built using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and managed using a public GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/technology-toolbox/website](https://github.com/technology-toolbox/website)

If you are interested in the changes included in this fork, please refer to the
**Subtext** tag on the Technology Toolbox website:
